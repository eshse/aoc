Day 24: It Hangs in the Balance

Santa needs to balance his sleigh by dividing packages into three equal-weight groups. 
The first group (passenger compartment) must have the fewest possible packages, and 
if multiple configurations exist, choose the one with the smallest "quantum entanglement" 
(product of package weights).

Part 2:
The sleigh has four compartments instead of three. Find the quantum entanglement of 
the first group when dividing packages into four equal-weight groups.
