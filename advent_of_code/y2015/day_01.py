"""
Day 1: Not Quite Lisp

Santa needs to find the correct floor by following instructions where "(" means going 
up one floor and ")" means going down one floor. The goal is to determine the final 
floor Santa reaches based on the input sequence of parentheses.

Part 2:
Find the position of the first character that causes Santa to enter the basement (floor -1).
