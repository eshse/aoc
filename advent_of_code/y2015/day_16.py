Day 16: Aunt Sue

Identify which of your 500 Aunt Sues gave you a gift by matching her characteristics 
against a crime scene analysis machine's output. Find the specific Aunt Sue whose 
attributes exactly match the MFCSAM's detected compounds and quantities.

Part 2:
The MFCSAM's readings are ranges, not exact values. For cats and trees, the actual 
value must be greater than the detected value. For pomeranians and goldfish, the 
actual value must be less than the detected value. Find the matching Aunt Sue.
