Day 21: RPG Simulator 20XX

Determine the least amount of gold needed to win a turn-based RPG battle. Players 
must strategically purchase weapons, optional armor, and rings from a shop to defeat 
a boss while spending the minimum gold possible.

Part 2:
Find the most amount of gold you can spend and still lose the fight. You must still 
buy at least one weapon, but you want to maximize your spending while ensuring defeat.
