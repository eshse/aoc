Day 10: Elves Look, Elves Say

Generate a "look-and-say" sequence iteratively. Starting with an initial number, 
each subsequent step describes the previous number by counting consecutive digit runs. 
Apply this process 40 times and determine the length of the final result.

Part 2:
Apply the look-and-say process 50 times instead of 40.
