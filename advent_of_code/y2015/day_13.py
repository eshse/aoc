Day 13: Knights of the Dinner Table

Find the optimal seating arrangement for a dinner party that maximizes total happiness. 
Guests have specific happiness gains or losses based on who sits next to them around 
a circular table.

Part 2:
Add yourself to the table. You have no happiness change from sitting next to anyone, 
and no one has a happiness change from sitting next to you. Find the optimal seating 
arrangement including yourself.
