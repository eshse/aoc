Day 14: Reindeer Olympics
https://adventofcode.com/2015/day/14

Calculate the distance traveled by reindeer in a race after 2503 seconds. Reindeer 
alternate between flying at top speed and resting, with each state lasting whole seconds. 
Determine which reindeer travels the farthest.

Part 2:
Instead of awarding points for distance, award one point each second to the reindeer 
currently in the lead. Find which reindeer has the most points after 2503 seconds.
