Day 2: I Was Told There Would Be No Math

Calculate the total square feet of wrapping paper needed for presents. For each box 
(with dimensions l x w x h), calculate the surface area plus the area of the smallest 
side as "slack".

Part 2:
Calculate the total feet of ribbon needed. Each present needs ribbon for the smallest 
perimeter around any face plus a bow equal to the cubic volume.
