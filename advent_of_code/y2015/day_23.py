Day 23: Opening the Turing Lock
https://adventofcode.com/2015/day/23

Simulate a simple computer with two registers (a and b) and six instructions. 
Determine the value in register 'b' when the program finishes executing by following 
instructions like halving, tripling, incrementing, and jumping based on register conditions.

Part 2:
Run the program again, but this time start with register 'a' initialized to 1 instead of 0. 
What is the value of register 'b' when the program finishes?
